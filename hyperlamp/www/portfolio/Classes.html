      <h3>These are some of the classes I've taken that are technology related</h3>
        <h2>Digital Photography</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Taken in 2013 as a highschool freshman. It was a photo editing class taught by Mr. Proctor using Gimp, the poor man's Photoshop. All of the projects were uploaded to Flickr to be shared with the teacher and the world. Even though it's been years since I took that class, I still remember what I've learned and still use Gimp at least once a week for different classes as well as personal use.</p>

        <h2>Video Game Development I - IV</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Taken from 2014 - 2015 over four semesters. The first semester was taught by Mr. Proctor and used GameMaker, which limited the amount of objects and rooms usable. The next three semesters were taught by Chad Frerichs and used Construct 2. It was these classes that started my ongoing theme of lamp usage and are the main focus of the main Hyper Lamp page. Over 30 different simple games were made throughout these classes, most of which were destroyed in a hard drive wipe in the high school computer lab. The four surviving games can be found on the main site, with more information in the Games tab of this portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Intro to Programming Logic</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a college class I took through Iowa Lakes Community College as a highschool senior. It began by working with pseudo-code and transitioned into C++. The projects are all simple programs made to teach the basics of the language and set up a foundation for coding in other languages.</p>
