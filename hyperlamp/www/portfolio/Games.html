        <h2>Games        </h2>
        <h3>Lamp Battle</h3>
        <p>Lamp Battle was made as a simpler version of the classic Space Battle arcade game. Like all it's predecessors, the main character was modified to be a lamp. Because it was made in GameMaker, the only way to play is to download the executable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>PokeLamp</h3>
        <p>Obviously it's a clear cut rip off of pokemon. It used pokemon sprites and mechanics with a lamp thrown in to make it my own. There are many problems with it, like restarting at the beginning of the forest after a battle, and enemy health disappearing during attacks, all of wich are caused by GameMaker's limited object count. Because it was made in GameMaker, the only way to play is to download the executable.</p>

        <h3>Hyper Lamp</h3>
        <p>As mentioned on the homepage it was intended to be the last game with a lamp, potentially the last game I made ever. It was named after the very first game I made that had a lamp moving at hyper speeds that you had to catch. It's a simple platformer that has the lamp looking for a new source of power while avoiding trees. It was made in Construct 2 and is playable on the game page.</p>

        <h3>Hyper Lamp 2.0</h3>
        <p>Hyper Lamp 2.0 was made in a group to simulate real world game development. Nick Houser did most of the programming, Cody Cother did some programming as well as level design, Sam Fisher was in charge of music and glitch testing, I made the sprites and models. It's still in a very early alpha, and it will be until the end of time because there are no more video game development classes for us all to take to work on it. It was going to be a platformer with multiple levels, enemies, and powerups, most of which was programmed but never implemented. It was made in Construct 2 and is playable on the game page.</p>

        <h2>Projects        </h2>
        <h3>Bus Tour of Songhai</h3>
        <p>It was made in Ancient World History in 2015The assignment was to make a bus tour of a given african civilization through the use of poster boards and maps. I found that to be boring, so I made the tour in Construct 2 so it could be an interactive presentation with simple animation. It centers around Songhai's great cities and leaders before it was invaded.</p>

        <h3>Hyper Lamp - The website</h3>
        <p>The main site itself was a project for Websites for the Masses, a j-term class in 2016. It's goal was to show my knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as to host the games I had made (or at least the ones that survived). Now it holds multiple other projects from other classes, this portfolio being the most recent.</p>
