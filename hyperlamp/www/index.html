			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Hyper Lamp, the home for all things lampy. All kinds of weird games and projects are hosted here. Through the games tab you can play lamp games (or at least the ones playable in browser) and read a brief history of each game. To see some
				projects I've experimented with or made for classes go to the projects tab. To learn more about me, the about me tab is the place to go.</p>
			<h2>History and Purpose</h2>
			<p>While the website has only been in existence for a couple years, Hyper Lamp (in it's simplest form) has existed since 2014. It started in Video Game Development I class where the very first assignment was to make a game about a bouncing ball. We had
				the option of personalization, so the ball was replaced with a lamp and sped up excessively. The objective became catching the lamp and clicking it, which was difficult because of it's hyper nature. That's when the title Hyper Lamp became established,
				and the lamp has been used in every game I made since then. Over the next 2 years over 30 (very simple) games were made, each with the main character being a lamp. It's been turned into a car, boat, spaceship, even a cow to make it fit into every
				single game made.</p>
			<p>Hyper Lamp as a website was originally made in Websites for the Masses, a J-Term class in 2016, with the purpose of hosting all of the games I made throughout high school. Sadly all of those games were made on the school's desktops which were wiped
				in late 2015. The only surviving games, all hosted on the main site page, survived because backups were made to be worked on outside of class.</p>
			<p>The first two games (Lamp Battle and PokeLamp) were made in GameMaker, which is why only the exported executables exist. Video Game Development III was the last available game development class, so Hyper Lamp - the game was made as the final project.
				It was meant to be the last game I made, so it was given the title of the first. The next semester, Video Game Development IV was unexpectedly announced, so I joined in and worked on a team for Hyper Lamp 2.0. Unlike the first Hyper Lamp, which was
				made solely by me, I only designed the art, and it was never completed.</p>
			<h2>New Uses</h2>
			<p>More recently, the website has been used to host random projects like the Tour of Songhai or my portfolio. Hyper Lamp has been growing and expanding as I learn more and add more to it. This current site is the second iteration of Hyper Lamp which was
				updated to be more apealling, informative, and accesable. It also acts as the final project for my Web Programming class.</p>
